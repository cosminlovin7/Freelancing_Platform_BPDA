Hi,

This is my implementation of the Freelancing Application project for the Blockchain Protocol and Distributed Algorithms course.
The UI implementation of the project can be found in the freelancing-platform-ui folder. It is written in TypeScript using ReactJS.
The smart-contract implementation is done using Rust and the blockchain platform used is testnet-multiversx.
The implementation of the smart-contract can be found in the smart-contract-impl folder.

Run:
yarn:build:testnet 
yarn:start:testnet
